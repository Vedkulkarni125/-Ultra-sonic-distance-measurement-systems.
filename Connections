Ultrasonic Sensor (e.g., HC-SR04):
- VCC: Connect to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
- GND: Connect to the GND pin on the Arduino.
- TRIGGER_PIN (Pin 9): Connect to Pin 9 on the Arduino.
- ECHO_PIN (Pin 10): Connect to Pin 10 on the Arduino.

LCD Display (I2C):
- GND: Connect to the GND pin on the Arduino.
- VCC: Connect to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
- SDA: Connect to the SDA pin on the Arduino (usually A4 on older models, or dedicated SDA pin on newer models like Uno R3).
- SCL: Connect to the SCL pin on the Arduino (usually A5 on older models, or dedicated SCL pin on newer models).
